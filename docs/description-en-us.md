# 🏆 QuickViz – Raise the Bar | Project Description (EN-US)

This document describes the concept, design choices, and purpose of the dashboard that won  
**QuickViz Week 1 – "Raise the Bar"**, released in this repository as a **PBIP project** for learning, reuse, and collaboration.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Visual

The challenge objective was to create a **single visual** that could:

- represent the **interests of the Fabric community**  
- highlight topic relevance and trends  
- use clear, minimal storytelling  
- offer helpful tips through tooltips  
- demonstrate how to **raise the bar with simplicity**  

The result is a clean, accessible, multilingual visual designed for fast understanding.

## 🧠 Concept & Idea

The guiding question was:

> **“How can one create impact with only one chart?”**

The solution combined:
- meaningful **AI-generated icons**  
- **smart tooltips** with mini-insights  
- **multilingual structure** (EN, ES, PT-BR)  
- **accessibility-first design**  
- clean layout with strict focus  

The visual embodies QuickViz philosophy:  
**Less clutter. More clarity.**
